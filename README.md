# rock-paper-scissors-

In this project my main task is to build a rock paper scissors program on plain js console. However, since I would like to practice more my other skills with HTML, CSS and DOM JS; I'll try to build the UI too. It's going to take more time, but the result will be much better. Good luck! 


Pseudocode:

Build a very minimalistic style page (like Kanye' store) where there are three possibility to choose from with radio inputs.

-Title

-Instructions

-Play button
    With a an event listener with a click on this button the possibilities are going to show up and the button goes away


-Possibilities
    In a container (using flexbox) put all the thing to choose from with an image above the radio selector for all the possibilities. When the radio selector is selected, a "confirm" button will show up and, if it's clicked, the computer will run the function.


-Function 



-Output
    The output should look like a random image of the three possibilities and a text saying if the user lost or won under it.
